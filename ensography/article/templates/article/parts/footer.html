            Article text type is set in Baskerville typeface whether this typeface is available on viewer device. Chrome text type is set in Helvetica Neue Light whether it is available in the same fashion. It is required to purchase these typefaces to use them as webfonts; non-profit nature of the research can not afford this, at least for now.
