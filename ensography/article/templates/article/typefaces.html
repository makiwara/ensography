		In this brief survey of the mobile parts of our body, we have, only in our extremities and head-mounted devices, close to a hundred directions and types of mobility (degrees of freedom). If we add the snakelike flexibility of our neck and trunk, the resulting number is enormous. The reader can probably sense already the difficulty of control of such a <em>multifaceted</em> mobility, but <strong>probably</strong> does not yet realize what the major problem is. Let us look methodically into all the difficulties and try to reveal the most challenging ones.

		If one takes into account <em><strong>that different movements</strong></em> in many joints take place simultaneously and that such unified movements as looking, walking, running, and throwing proceed in the form of finely tuned, cooperative synergies, one of the difficulties becomes immediately obvious in its full extent. How enormous would be the distribution of attention if all the elements of such complex movements were controlled separately with close attention to each of them! In some patients with brain injury resulting from tumor removal from certain brain areas, one can see the loss of the ability to control complex movements voluntarily.
